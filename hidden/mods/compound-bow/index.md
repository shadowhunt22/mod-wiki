## Information and Description

This mod adds a new weapon to the game: the compound bow and arrow.  This powerful weapon is unlike the vanilla bow and arrow; it is accurate, faster, and deadly.

That goes without saying, all credit goes to `agentley` for the idea and fantastic textures to create this mod while I was given the charge to bring it to life.

- Compound bow: pulls back twice as fast as a normal bow.  Fires the compound arrow with perfect aim and 25% more speed than a normal bow and arrow.
- Compound arrow: the only arrow the compound bow can fire.  Applies 25% more damage than a normal bow and arrow.
- Other items necessary to craft the bow such as,
    - Compound blueprint
    - Compound wheel
